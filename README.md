# DoggyApp

## Introduction

This is a mobile application for new dog owners developed by our team as part of the post gratuation project at [SALT](https://salt.study/).
 The app is developed with React Native (using [expo.io](https://expo.io/)) and Type Script for the front end. The data is fetched from the backend using Apollo GraphQl.
 The back end code is in separate repo available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Danijela2019/DoggyApp-backEnd).
